				<h2>Why do we need different approach?</h2>
				<p>Because hackers tend to think different than many others. Everyday cybersecurity related events evolve and change their shape. It’s too rare to find an example where hackers used the same technique again and again. A perfect example for this would be the word “bypass”. Bypassing malware detection, WAF’s and Human Mind. Almost %90 of the cyber-attacks has one thing in common, Social Engineering. That’s one of the reasons why people need to get a customized and updated awareness material all the time.</p>
